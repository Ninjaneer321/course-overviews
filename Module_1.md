# Module 1: The `coding mindset` and intro to `python` as a language

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

**Formulate and execute a strategic plan for earth-resource data analysis**, including:
- Discuss and debate resources for critical thinking about coding, help on errors, etc.
- Design a concept map for a dataset that you are interested in, using the discussion and readings as a guide
- Hack together your first python code!

## Assessments
- intro discussion board
- intro quiz on python knowledge
  - short essay about what you want out of the course
- discussion board about design thinking
- concept map and colab notebook

## Developing a coding mindset using design thinking

Do you need fancy data science, or can you just use Excel? If you can't do what you want to do in Excel, `python` allows you to be more efficient by automating tasks, visualizing data in ways impossible for Excel to do, etc. Python also has the added bonus of being open-source (i.e., free!), with TONS of specialized packages, customization, and support via discussion boards available.

## Think strategically instead of focusing on what data you may have.
Too often companies say "we have some data, let's machine-learn it" instead of reflecting on what may be value-adding problems to solve (and thus data to collect).

## Colab notebooks
- Markdown cells
- Importing packages and data
- Running cells
- reading errors

## Apply your knowledge
Design a concept map for a predefined dataset, and using the discussion and readings as a guide, hack together a Colab notebook that does something with it (submit photo of concept map and notebook html as assessment)
