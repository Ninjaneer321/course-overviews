# Module 7-8: Final project

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

**Formulate and execute a strategic plan for earth-resource data analysis**, including:
- Creating a concept map for data analysis
- Wrangling, comparing, and visualizing data
- Summarize data analysis with reproducible, commented code and figures
- Advance knowledge of earth-science using actual data instead of conjecture!

## Assessments
- asdf

## Final project

### Choosing or creating a dataset
we can provide one, or you can bring your own (must be something you cant do in Excel)

### Design thinking
Instead of just diving in, spend some time thinking about what you want to achieve and plan for it (i.e., question-based vs. 'let's see what's in the data')

### Data wrangling
usually 80% of the work

### Data-Viz and statistical analysis
you need domain knowledge to know what information to condense/convey/viz

### Apply machine-learning models
Do you need to? If so, proceed with caution, and remember parsimony

## Reflection
