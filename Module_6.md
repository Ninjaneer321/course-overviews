# Module 6: Machine-learning

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

**Implement machine-learning models for earth-resource data and understand common pitfalls**, including:
- Understand common machine-learning methods and models
- Choose the appropriate model for a given dataset using domain knowledge (i.e., geological intuition)
- Discuss common pitfalls, model uncertainty and interpretability, as well as the importance of training data

## Assessments
- asdf

## Design thinking
- Do you need to?
- AI vs. ML: If it is written in Python, it's probably machine learning. If it is written in PowerPoint, it's probably AI https://twitter.com/matvelloso/status/1065778379612282885?s=20
- model choices https://twitter.com/seanjtaylor/status/1251043814715711489
- Training data and GIGO
- Model interpretability

## Unsupervised machine-learning

what about MVR????

## Supervised machine-learning
- random forest
- decision tree and XGBoost, AdaBoost

### Deep learning
- RNN LSTM on well logs
- 1D CNN
  - Spotify, litholog
- 2D CNN on images (Dan Buscombe dataset?)
