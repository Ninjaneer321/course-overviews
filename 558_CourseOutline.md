# GEOL 558 Course Outline

**Earth-Resource Data Science II: Applications and Machine-Learning**

An 8 week-long asynchronous online course to apply advanced concepts of data science as it pertains to characterization, extraction, and sustainable development of surface and subsurface Earth resources, and give examples in `python` that can be used in daily geoscience workflows.

The time commitment is approximately 15 hours per week for 8 weeks. The only materials needed are a computer and a google account for using Colab.

Applicable fields of earth-science include:
- petroleum geologists (conventional and unconventional-focused)
- economic geologists (mining, ore-deposits, critical minerals)
- geological engineers / engineering geologists (construction, tunneling)
- environmental geologists (remote-sensing, land-use change)
- hydro-geologists and hydrologists (water-resources)
- geomorphologists (sand and water resources, landscape evolution)

## Major course themes and learning outcomes
- Synthesize and analyze earth-resource data from multiple sources using python and geoscience domain knowledge
  - Week 2 project 
  - Week 7 
- Construct python code to retrieve earth-resource data using APIs (application programming interfaces) 
  - Week 3 macrostrat
  - Week 4 Enverus token
  - sub theme: understand web scraping algorithms for retrieving earth-resource data
    - web scraping of CO data (similar to API) and intro to browser-based scraper intro
- Develop and implement unsupervised machine-learning models
  - week 5 stuff
- Develop and implement (i.e., test and train) supervised machine-learning models
  - week 6 stuff
- Analyze and critique results of nachine-learing results for earth-resource data

## Schedule
1. go find data and do stuff (557 refresher)
1. Understanding a package, pip/conda, environments, Github, functions (no copy-paste a long plotting function)
1. APIs and web scraping
1. unsup ML
1. sup ML
1. whiteboarding an ML project and critique a paper - does it pass the sniff test?
1. revisit "go find data and do stuff" 
1. peer review and wrap up
