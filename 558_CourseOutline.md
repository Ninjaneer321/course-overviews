# GEOL 558 Course Outline

**Earth-Resource Data Science II: Applications and Machine-Learning**

An 8 week-long asynchronous online course to apply advanced concepts of data science as it pertains to characterization, extraction, and sustainable development of surface and subsurface Earth resources, and give examples in `python` that can be used in daily geoscience workflows.

The time commitment is approximately 15 hours per week for 8 weeks.

Applicable fields of earth-science include:
- petroleum geologists (conventional and unconventional-focused)
- economic geologists (mining, ore-deposits, critical minerals)
- geological engineers / engineering geologists (construction, tunneling)
- environmental geologists (remote-sensing, land-use change)
- hydro-geologists and hydrologists (water-resources)
- geomorphologists (sand and water resources, landscape evolution)

The only necessary materials will be a computer that you have admin rights to in order to install python and its various packages.

Prerequisites:
- DSCI 403 Introduction to Data Science
- GEOL 557 Earth Resource Data Science I: Fundamentals

## Weekly schedule
1. go find data and do stuff (557 refresher)
1. installing python, reading a package, pip/conda, environments, functions vs scripts
1. APIs and web scraping (Enverus, macrostrat, COGCC)
1. unsup ML
1. sup ML
1. whiteboarding an ML project and critique a paper - does it pass the sniff test?
1. make a package with functions in order to revisit "go find data and do stuff"
1. peer review and wrap up

---

After successful completion of the course, learners will be able to:

### 1. Synthesize and analyze earth-resource data from multiple sources using python and geoscience domain knowledge
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 1 documentation of solo project 1 showing data compilation, analysis, and geoscientific importance
- Week 7 documentation of solo project 2 showing data compilation, analysis, and geoscientific importance

### 2. Create a python package for earth-resource data analysis
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 8 python package creation for solo project 2

#### Subthemes:
- Installing python, pip/conda, environments
  - Formative assessment: Week 2 exercises
- Scripts vs. functions
  - Formative assessments:
    - Week 2 exercises

### 3. Construct python code to retrieve earth-resource data using APIs (application programming interfaces) and web-scraping algorithms
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 3 scaffolded notebooks testing knowledge of APIs and web-scraping

#### Subthemes:
- Web-scraping ethics
  - Formative assessment: Week 3 reflection

### 4. Develop and implement unsupervised machine-learning models for earth-resource data
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 4 notebooks on unsupervised ML techniques

### 5. Develop and implement (i.e., test-and-train) supervised machine-learning models for earth-resource data
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 5 notebooks on supervised ML techniques

### 6. Analyze and critique results of machine-learning results for earth-resource data
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 6 exercises ??

#### Subtheme:
- How fancy does your ML need to be?
  - Formative assessments:
    - Week 6 discussion on supervised ML architectures, and if 80% is good enough
