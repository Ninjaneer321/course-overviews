# Module 2: `python` syntax and data wrangling

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

**Import, wrangle, and analyze earth-resource data using python syntax, data types, data storage, and common packages (e.g., pandas)**, including:
- Use python syntax to successfully import, analyze, and export data
- Differentiate common data types (e.g., string, float), the importance of selecting the correct data type, and how to manipulate data types
- Apply concepts of indexing and split-apply-combine methods to clean, sort, and distill real-world data

## Assessments
- fill-in-the-blank quiz about syntax, data types, etc.
- Colab notebook about syntax that gets peer-reviewed
- Data wrangling Colab notebook
- Crowd-sourced cheat sheet

## python syntax
- 0 not 1
- array, int, float, str, list, dict, tuple, boolean
- indexing and slicing
- operators (e.g., +, -, \*, /, ==, !=, <, <=)
- loops
  - for i in x,for x in range(), ;

### readings
- asdf

## pandas
- importing data into series, dataframe (index, columns, data), and head(), describe(), etc.
- wrangling (dtypes, NaNs, etc)
- groupby (agg, sort, mean, etc.)
- indexing ([ ], loc, iloc)
- split-apply-combine
- operations `apply()``
- pandas loops to pull out variables and plot stuff (for name, group in df.groupby('a'):)

need to write a notebook that finds weird things like 5576..00 and 5,576.00 and 5576.;00 instead of 5576.00
