# GEOL 5XX Earth Resource Data Science I: Fundamentals

## Description
A hands-on course intended to introduce basic concepts and give working examples of python code that can be used in daily geoscience workflows. 

### Audience
This course is tailored for geologists, geophysicists, petrophysicists, petroleum engineers, and anyone else that would like to gain skills in practical python programming, data mining, and machine learning. While this course will use examples from the petroleum industry, any earth scientist will benefit from the geospatial and subsurface data analysis techniques."	

## Course Goals
- Introduce the python programing language for the earth scientist (syntax, data types, loops)
- Introduce python libraries for data import, analysis, plotting, and export 
- Learn to work with spreadsheets, shapefiles, well log data, and other common geo-data
- Provide hands on examples of data visualization, data mining, and machine learning techniques
