# Module 1: The `coding mindset` and intro to `python` as a language

## Overview and Objectives

Learning to code is very similar to learning a new language - there is vocabulary, rules on how to structure 'sentences' and conjugate verbs - it can be difficult and frustrating, but also very rewarding! This first module will help you learn to 'think like a programmer' and design a strategy for a project before you begin coding. Then, you will put this knowledge into practice, by building your first data-science project!

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

**Formulate and execute a strategic plan for earth-resource data analysis**, including:
- Discuss and debate resources for critical thinking about coding, help on errors, etc.
- Design a concept map for a dataset using the discussion and readings as a guide
- Hack together your first python code!

## Assessments
- intro discussion board
  - short essay in Canvas about what you want out of the course
- notebook showing Syntax notebook
- discussion board about design thinking (in slack)
- concept map and colab notebook

## Developing a coding mindset using design thinking

Do you need fancy data science, or can you just use Excel? If you can't do what you want to do in Excel, `python` allows you to be:
- error-free, most importantly
- more efficient by automating tasks
- visualizing data in ways impossible for Excel

Python also has the added bonus of being open-source (i.e., free!), with TONS of specialized packages, customization, and support via discussion boards available.

## Think strategically instead of focusing on what data you may have.
Too often companies say "we have some data, let's machine-learn it" instead of reflecting on what may be value-adding problems to solve (and thus data to collect).

- https://www.dataversity.net/data-science-vs-domain-expertise-who-can-best-deliver-solutions/ quote "The Domain Expertâ€™s greatest strength is the ability to identify which questions need to be answered, and the Data Scientists role is to maneuver and leverage advanced data technologies to build expert systems to answer those questions."
- https://towardsdatascience.com/minimum-viable-domain-knowledge-in-data-science-5be7bc99eca9 quote "It is simply not possible to do useful data science without sufficient domain knowledge."

## Apply your knowledge
Design a concept map for a predefined dataset, and using the discussion and readings as a guide, hack together a Colab notebook that does something with it (submit photo of concept map and notebook html as assessment)
