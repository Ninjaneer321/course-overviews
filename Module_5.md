# Module 5: Summary and comparative statistics

After successful completion of the module, learners will be able to:

**Design methods for statistical analysis of earth-resource data using numpy and scipy packages**, including:
- Descriptive and summary statistics (e.g., mean, median)
- Comparative statistics (e.g., comparing two datasets)

## Assessments
- asdf

## Distributions, log-normality, and the log10 scale
- 1D distributions
  - normal, log-normal, log10, log2
    - the mean may be meaningless
- CDF, KDE, percentiles, other univariate descriptors
  - operations (* vs @; +=)
    - see page 58 of Python Data Science Handbook by Jake Vanderplas
  - np.max and argmax, percentile

## Comparative statistics
- Using descriptive statistics qualitatively (e.g., comparing distributions)
- Linear regression
- More quantitative methods
  - scipy.interpolate; scipy.stats
  - Parametric t test
  - Non-parametric KS test
