# GEOL 557 Course Outline

**Earth-Resource Data Science I: Fundamentals**

An 8 week-long asynchronous online course to introduce concepts of data science as it pertains to characterization, extraction, and sustainable development of surface and subsurface Earth resources, and give examples in `python` that can be used in daily geoscience workflows.

The time commitment is approximately 15 hours per week for 8 weeks. The only materials needed are a computer and a google account for using Colab.

Applicable fields of earth-science include:
- petroleum geologists (conventional and unconventional-focused)
- economic geologists (mining, ore-deposits, critical minerals)
- geological engineers / engineering geologists (construction, tunneling)
- environmental geologists (remote-sensing, land-use change)
- hydro-geologists and hydrologists (water-resources)
- geomorphologists (sand and water resources, landscape evolution)

## Major course themes and learning outcomes

After successful completion of the course, learners will be able to:

### 1. Formulate and execute a strategic plan for earth-resource data analysis
- Apply earth-resource-specific packages to solve common problems in the energy, minerals, and environmental industries
- Reflect on coding-as-a-language and the Excel vs `python` mindset
- Assessments:
  - week 1 discussion
  - week 1, 7 concept map creation
  - week 8 video presentation of final project

### 2. Import, wrangle, and analyze earth-resource data using python syntax, data types, data storage, and pandas
- Compare useful data types, syntax, and commonly-used earth-science packages in python
- Clean and sort messy, real-world data using `pandas`
- Create reproducible python workflows that solve real-world problems  
- Assessments:
  - week 2 essay on data storage best practices
  - week 1, 2 scaffolded notebooks testing knowledge of syntax, data types, and pandas
  - week 3 crowd-sourced list and description of geo-specific python packages

### 3. Visualize earth-resource data
- Create beautiful, reproducible plots that convey information using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Analyze and plot surface and subsurface geospatial data using python mapping packages (e.g., `ipyleaflet`)
- Reflect on the principles of effective graphic design
- Assessments:
  - week 4 discussion on the good, bad, and ugly in data-viz
  - week 4 scaffolded notebooks
  - week 7 visualization of final project data

### 4. Design and implement methods for statistical analysis of earth-resource data
- Report descriptive and comparative statistics using `numpy` and `scipy`
- Use domain knowledge to create and contrast appropriate statistics for a given dataset
- Assessments:
  - week 5 quiz on descriptive statistics
  - week 2, 5 crowd-sourced stats cheatsheet
  - week 7 comparative statistical analysis

### 5. Implement machine-learning models for earth-resource data
- Explain differences in supervised and unsupervised models and use-cases for each
- Discuss common pitfalls, model uncertainty & interpretability, and the importance of training data
- Assessments:
  - week 6 quiz on ML terminology and architecture
  - week 6 essay on ML pros, cons, and pitfalls
  - week 7 ML implementation for final project
