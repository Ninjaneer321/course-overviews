# GEOL 557 Course Outline

**Earth-Resource Data Science I: Fundamentals**

An 8 week-long asynchronous online course to introduce concepts of data science as it pertains to characterization, extraction, and sustainable development of surface and subsurface Earth resources, and give examples in `python` that can be used in daily geoscience workflows.

The time commitment is approximately 15 hours per week for 8 weeks. The only materials needed are a computer and a google account for using Colab.

Applicable fields of earth-science include:
- petroleum geologists (conventional and unconventional-focused)
- economic geologists (mining, ore-deposits, critical minerals)
- geological engineers / engineering geologists (construction, tunneling)
- environmental geologists (remote-sensing, land-use change)
- hydro-geologists and hydrologists (water-resources)
- geomorphologists (sand and water resources, landscape evolution)

## Major course themes and learning outcomes

After successful completion of the course, learners will be able to:

### 1. Formulate and execute a strategic plan for earth-resource data analysis
**Summative assessment:** Week 8 presentation and documentation of final project that shows pythonic execution of a strategic data-analysis plan

#### Subthemes:
- Apply earth-resource-specific packages to solve common problems in the energy, minerals, and environmental industries
  - Formative assessment: Week 3 scaffolded notebooks
- Discuss the coding mindset and the importance of design thinking and domain knowledge in data-science projects
  - Formative assessments:
    - Week 1 discussion/essay on resources for critical thinking, debugging, etc.
    - Week 1 concept map (i.e., strategic plan) creation
    - Week 7 concept map (i.e., strategic plan) creation

### 2. Import, wrangle, and analyze (often messy) earth-resource data using python syntax, data types, data storage, and `pandas`
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 1 scaffolded notebooks testing knowledge of python syntax and data types
- Week 2 scaffolded notebooks testing knowledge of pandas
- Week 3 scaffolded notebooks testing knowledge of earth-resource python packages

#### Subthemes:
- Compare useful data types, syntax, and commonly-used earth-science packages in python
  - Formative assessments:
    - Week 2 crowd-sourced list of useful pandas one-liners
    - Week 3 crowd-sourced list and description of geo-specific python packages
- Discuss best practices for organization, storage, and curation of earth-resource data
  - Formative assessments:
    - Week 2 data reorganization exercise
    - Week 2 reflection (in essay form) on data storage best practices

### 3. Create visualizations for earth-resource data (e.g., surface, subsurface, geospatial, analytical datasets)
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 4 scaffolded notebooks testing knowledge of data visualization
- Week 7 visualization of final project data

#### Subtheme:
- Reflect on the principles of effective graphic design
  - Formative assessment: Week 4 discussion on the good, bad, and ugly in data-viz

### 4. Design and implement methods for statistical analysis of earth-resource data
**Summative assessments:**
- Week 5 quiz testing knowledge of descriptive and comparative statistics and how to utilize them in `numpy` and `scipy`
- Week 7 comparative statistical analysis of final project data

#### Subthemes:
- Evaluate parametric and non-parametricÂ statistical approaches for data comparisons
  - Formative assessment: Week 5 scaffolded notebook
- Use domain knowledge to contrast appropriate statistics for a given dataset
  - Formative assessments:
    - Week 5 discussion on relevant statistics and the rabbit-hole of p values
    - Week 5 crowd-sourced list of useful scipy one-liners

### 5. Differentiate machine-learning models for earth-resource data
**Summative assessment:** Week 6 successful completion of Google's machine-learning course

#### Subthemes:
- Identify differences in supervised and unsupervised ML models and use-cases for each
  - Formative assessment: Week 6 quiz on ML terminology and architecture
- Discuss common pitfalls, model uncertainty & interpretability, and the importance of training data
  - Formative assessment: week 6 essay/discussion on ML pros, cons, and pitfalls
