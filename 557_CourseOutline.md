# GEOL 557 Course Outline

**Earth-Resource Data Science I: Fundamentals**

An 8 week-long asynchronous online course to introduce concepts of data science as it pertains to characterization, extraction, and sustainable development of surface and subsurface Earth resources, and give examples in `python` that can be used in daily geoscience workflows.

The time commitment is approximately 15 hours per week for 8 weeks. The only materials needed are a computer and a google account for using Colab.

Applicable fields of earth-science include:
- petroleum geologists (conventional and unconventional-focused)
- economic geologists (mining, ore-deposits, critical minerals)
- geological engineers / engineering geologists (constrution, tunneling)
- environmental geologists (remote-sensing, land-use change)
- hydro-geologists and hydrologists (water-resources)
- geomorphologists (sand and water resources, landscape evolution)

## Major themes

After successful completion of the course, learners will be able to:

**1. Formulate and execute a strategic plan for earth-resource data analysis**
  - Apply earth-resource-specific packages to solve common problems in the energy, minerals, and environmental industries
  - Reflect on coding-as-a-language and the Excel vs `python` mindset

**2. Import, wrangle, and analyze earth-resource data using python syntax, data types, data storage, and pandas**
  - Compare useful data types, syntax, and commonly-used earth-science packages in python
  - Clean and sort messy, real-world data using `pandas`
  - Create reproducible python workflows that solve real-world problems  

**3. Design and implement methods for statistical analysis of earth-resource data**
  - Report descriptive and comparative statistics using `numpy` and `scipy`
  - Use domain knowledge to create and contrast appropriate statistics for a given dataset

**4. Visualize earth-resource data**
  - Create beautiful, reproducible plots that convey information using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - Analyze and plot surface and subsurface geospatial data using python mapping packages (e.g., `ipyleaflet`)
  - Reflect on the principles of effective graphic design

**5. Implement machine-learning models for earth-resource data**
  - Explain differences in supervised and unsupervised models and use-cases for each
  - Discuss common pitfalls, model uncertainty & interpretability, and the importance of training data
