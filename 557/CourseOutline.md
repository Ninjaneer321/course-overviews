Time - 8 weeks?; Hours - XX

## Course-level learning outcomes

**1. Recognize `python` syntax, data types, and common packages**
  - Implement python code to solve common earth-resource problems
  - Reflect on coding-as-a-language and the Excel-vs-python mindset

**2. Construct python notebooks to import, analyze, and visualize earth-resource data**
  - Define data types, syntax, and commonly-used packages in python
  - Understand different python installations and Github integration

**3. Explore, organize, and summarize earth-resource data using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy`**
  - Clean and sort messy, real-world data   
  - Report descriptive and comparative statistics

**4. Visualize earth-resource data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`**
  - Create beautiful plots that convey information
  - Reflect on the principles of effective graphic design

**5. Apply earth-resource-specific packages to analyze/visualize data and solve common problems**
  - Examine common earth-resource data types (e.g., satellite imagery using `skimage`, well-logs using `lasio`, time-series data)
  - Use python to automate tasks and save time

**6. Implement machine-learning models for earth-resource data**
  - Explain differences in supervised and unsupervised models and when to use each
  - Discuss model uncertainty and interpretability, as well as the importance of training data

**7. (not sure about this one) Integrate earth-surface and subsurface data in a geospatial framework**
  - Utilize common geospatial packages to co-visualize different data types
